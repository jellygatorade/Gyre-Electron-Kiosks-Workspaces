          "description": "On the central platform to your right is a sawfish mask, which embodies one type of water spirit. The first film shows additional Ijo water spirits, including a shark and mullet. The spirits arrive by boat, and an elaborate reenactment of fishing expeditions takes place. Additionally, the masquerade performers drink medicines and chase spectators, both signs of their power."

Constructed primarily of leaves and reaching fifteen to eighteen feet tall, these Koro ensembles are destroyed after each performance. Many spectators film the proceedings on phones, tablets, and cameras to create their own documentation of these spectacular processions."
