    "description": "The fifth masquerade is a comical mask known as gongoli. An example is on view in this gallery. Gongoli is a beloved character of Mende origin (Sierra Leone). Always the buffoon, he is performed as drunken and bumbling, to the delight of any children witnessing his antics. Gongoli also routinely performs at funerals to lighten the seriousness of the mood."
